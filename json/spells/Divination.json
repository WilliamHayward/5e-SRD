The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.</p><p>The spell doesn\u2019t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.</p><p>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>",
