When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can\u2019t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.</p><p>If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn\u2019t grow older.</p><p>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include \u201cafter 1,000 years\u201d or \u201cwhen the tarrasque awakens.\u201d This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.</p>",
