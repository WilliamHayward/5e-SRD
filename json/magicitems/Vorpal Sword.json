        "You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.", 
        "When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature\u2019s heads. The creature dies if it can\u2019t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn\u2019t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit."
