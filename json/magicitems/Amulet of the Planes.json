        "While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the *plane shift* spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1\u201360, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61\u2013100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence."
