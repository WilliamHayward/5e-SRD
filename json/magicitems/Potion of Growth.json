        "When you drink this potion, you gain the \u201cenlarge\u201d effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion\u2019s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process."
