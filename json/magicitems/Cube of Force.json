        "This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.", 
        "You can use an action to press one of the cube\u2019s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube\u2019s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier\u2019s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.",
