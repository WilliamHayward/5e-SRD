        "When you drink this potion, you gain the \u201creduce\u201d effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion\u2019s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process."
