{"name": "Stone Shape", "desc": "<p>You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn\u2019t possible.</p>", "page": "phb 278", "range": "Touch", "components": "V, S, M", "material": "Soft clay, to be crudely worked into the desired shape for the stone object.", "ritual": "no", "duration": "Instantaneous", "concentration": "no", "casting_time": "1 action", "level": "4th-level", "school": "Transmutation", "class": "Cleric, Druid, Wizard", "circles": "Mountain, Underdark"}
