Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p><p>When a creature enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can\u2019t assume a different form until it leaves the spell\u2019s light.</p><p>On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.</p>",
