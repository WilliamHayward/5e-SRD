{"name": "Harm", "desc": "<p>You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can\u2019t reduce the target\u2019s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature\u2019s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.</p>", "page": "phb 249", "range": "60 feet", "components": "V, S", "ritual": "no", "duration": "Instantaneous", "concentration": "no", "casting_time": "1 action", "level": "6th-level", "school": "Necromancy", "class": "Cleric"}
