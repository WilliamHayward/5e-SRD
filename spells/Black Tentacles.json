{"name": "Black Tentacles", "desc": "<p>Dark writhing tentacles occupy the ground in a square of 90 feet ridge you can see the range of the spell. For the duration of the spell, the tentacles make the difficult terrain.</p><p>When a creature enters the affected area for the first time in a turn or where it begins its turn, it must make a dexterity saving throw or it suffers 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is hampered by tentacles until the end of the spell. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already hampered by the tentacles suffers 3d6 bludgeoning damage.</p><p>A creature hampered by the tentacles can use his action to a test Strength or Dexterity (at its option) opposite to the SD backup of your fate. If successful, it is free.</p>", "page": "phb 238", "range": "90 feet", "components": "V, S, M", "material": "A piece of tentacle of an octopus or a giant squid.", "ritual": "no", "duration": "Up to 1 minute", "concentration": "yes", "casting_time": "1 action", "level": "4th-level", "school": "Conjuration", "class": "Warlock, Wizard", "archetype": "Warlock: Great Old One", "patrons": "Great Old One"}
